Activity Learning (AL)

AL includes activity recognition (AR), activity discovery (AD), and
activity prediction (AP). Type 'make' to compile AL. AR is based on C4.5
and AP is based on M5.  Most of the options for these classifiers are
included as #define constants in the al.h file.

Usage for AR:    ./al -r <config_file> [<data_file>]

Usage for AP:    ./al -p <config_file> [<data_file>]

Usage for AD:    ./al -d <config_file>

Usage for GLOOX: ./al -a <config_file>

Usage for SQL:   ./al -f <config_file>

See AL manual for more details.
